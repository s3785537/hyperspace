							<p>My name is Amante Docherty and i am a first year student at RMIT University studying Information Technology. I was born in Melbourne Australia and am currently living in Werribee with my Mum, Dad and my two younger sisters. My mum is from the Philippines and moved to Australia, and my dad was born in Australia after his family moved to Australia after Scotland. Some of my hobbies include gaming, freestyle bmx, and watching such like YouTube or Netflix. Games that I like to play are mainly motorsport games like Assetto Corsa, Forza, Gran Turismo and Need For Speed. Other genres of games I like are fps, open world games and whatever I can play for free. In my spare time when I don't feel like playing games i like to watch YouTube and Netflix. YouTube videos that I like to watch are car related videos, gaming videos, vlogs, music videos and fashion/streetwear videos. An interesting fact about me is that I have pet dog named Marvel who I've had since I was 3, but recently found out that I'm allergic to dogs.
