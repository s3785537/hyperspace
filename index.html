									<h2>Personal Information</h2>
									<p>Student number: s3785537<p>
									<p>Email address: s3785537@student.rmit.edu.au<p>
									<p> <p>
									<p>My name is Amante Docherty and i am a first year student at RMIT University studying Information Technology. I was born in Melbourne Australia and am currently living in Werribee with my Mum, Dad and my two younger sisters. My mum is from the Philippines and moved to Australia, and my dad was born in Australia after his family moved to Australia after Scotland. Some of my hobbies include gaming, freestyle bmx, and watching such like YouTube or Netflix. Games that I like to play are mainly motorsport games like Assetto Corsa, Forza, Gran Turismo and Need For Speed. Other genres of games I like are fps, open world games and whatever I can play for free. In my spare time when I don't feel like playing games i like to watch YouTube and Netflix. YouTube videos that I like to watch are car related videos, gaming videos, vlogs, music videos and fashion/streetwear videos. An interesting fact about me is that I have pet dog named Marvel who I've had since I was 3, but recently found out that I'm allergic to dogs.

									<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
									<p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there particular event or person that sparked your interests? Outline your IT experience (If any).<p>
									<p>- My interest in IT is how it is now associated with many aspects of our lives and society, as well as the things that we are able to create with the help of IT. Another part of IT which i have an interest in is games, as they have been part of most of  my life. A reason I have chosen IT is so that I can learn about what goes on behind the technology that people use daily. I find it fascinating that technology has created the world we are living in today and that the possibilities of it are endless. From when I was born to know technology has advanced greatly, providing new capabilities with appliances that were first created many years before. An example of this are mobile phones which are now able to take photos/videos, answer questions, give you directions, communicate with people from all around the world via text, voice or video, etc. My interest in IT is to be part of its growth and applications to make the world a better place. I do not know exactly when my interest in IT started however getting my first laptop may have been a contributor to this. In 2011 when I was in grade 5 I had got a MacBook from my schools BYOD(Bring Your Own Device) program, which I had constantly used to do school work, play games, use photoshop and video editing, until its hard drive crashed in 2015. One person who might have sparked my interest was my video editing teacher who had a background in Information Technology who then later was my computing teacher in year 11. My IT experience is very limited however i have done a small amount of java coding in year 11 computing class. Last year I had built my first computer which I was a fun and exciting experience as I learned about the parts that make up a computer.<p>

									<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<p>
									<p>- I chose RMIT because I had been to many events held at RMIT such as open days, Atar Notes lectures and a day in the life where i was able to feel as though I was a student at RMIT. Through these events I experienced the positive culture and atmosphere the institution had to offer and made it clear that I wanted to be part of it. As well as this the SNAP program that RMIT provides helped me get into IT as I did not perform as well as I wanted in VCE. Another reason I chose RMIT is because of the location. Although it is far from my home in Werribee I am able to easily access a train station to catch a train straight to RMIT. I love the fact that RMIT is based in the city because it makes my experience studying feel more lively and there is a large variety of food and activities I can access when I am not studying.<p>

									<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<p>
									- During my studies at RMIT I expect to learn various coding languages and how to apply it to real world problems. With this i am also hoping to be able understand how games and other applications are made, and how they work. With my current interest in networking, cyber security, programming and games I want to learn the skills I need to work in company's where i can practice these skills as a job. I also want to be able to make a hobby out of these interests where I can make new relationships with people of the same interest and furthermore expand from what I have learned from my studies.

									<p>This job position that I have chosen is as an IT cyber security analyst. This position is being advertised by Kinexus for another business which is requiring a cyber security analyst. 
									The tasks that this position requires me to do are primarily based around protecting the businesses operations and integrity. In particular what makes this position appealing to me is the aspect of protecting data from possible external and internal threats to the business. 
									With my one of my new interests being cyber security, this position would conveniently fit with my interest. As the cyber security analyst for this business, the skills i must have must correspond to the key responsibilities that the job advertise has provided. 
									These key responsibilities include issuing technical support and cyber solutions, resolve security issues the business may be suffering, ensuring the business meets security compliance requirements, aid in the collection and analysis of data, and help and guide the implementation of new projects. 
									The expected experience for position candidates are 3-5 years of experience in an ICT environment as a cyber security analyst, ability to keep cyber security matters confidential, familiarity with Project Management Procedures and methods and past involvement with reviewing software for possible threats. 
									General qualifications employers are seeking in their candidates  for cyber security analyst positions include bachelor degrees in computer science, information technology and programming or related other related courses. Currently I do not have any  skills, qualifications or experiences that can be applied to this position however i wish to acquire these as I get closer to the end of my studies. To acquire these skills and experience I am hoping to participate in extra curricular activities and make new friends interested in the same area of IT, in order to make my learning experience more enjoyable. A way for me to these are through the RMIT CSIT society which hosts various IT related events as well as events to meet new people and build new relations.

							<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
							<p>For my project idea I would like to create a virtual reality application that is able to imitate many real-life activities. This application will also imitate real life physics and other things as such. I think this project is interesting because I find the idea of virtual reality fascinating as it allows users to experience the virtual world as though they are living in it. 
								The main objective of this application will be to create a simulation of workplace tasks that can be monitored by employers or trainers. This can range from a variety of labour-intensive jobs such as engineering to tradie jobs. This project will be interesting because virtual reality is an experience everyone enjoys including me. Creating a virtual world that imitates the looks and physics of the real-world will be interesting as I would be able to compare the two different worlds side by side. 
								In relation to imitating the real world, this can be a great way to assess employees or potential employees to see whether they are correctly and safely performing their work without the risk of accident. In 2017 the number of work-related fatalities added up to a total of 190 according to SafeWorkAustralia. 
								With the help of virtual reality training/assessments it can reduce the number of employees unfit for their jobs from risking injury and it can allow them to learn of possible accidents that may occur in the workplace. The features of this service include realistic physics, graphics, noises and minimal implementation of realistic feeling/touch. This will be achieved though the use of Unreal engine which will provide a close to real life looking 3d world and 3d models. 
								The physics or this will also closely replicate those of real life. Advantages of these are that users are able to immerse themselves into the virtual world as though they were actually at the workplace so that. Furthermore props that replicate the feel of real tools such as drills, hammers, screwdrivers, etc will have sensors programmed to simulate movement in the virtual world. 
								The user will be able to see and feel these tools as though they were working, keeping in mind that the machinery such as saws and drills, and heavy machinery such as forklifts and excavators will not have working motors to ensure the safety of the user. Another feature of this will be motion capture gloves with sensors that capture enough data to closely replicate the movement of the user’s hands. 
								The movements of the user will also be captured by motion sensors on their feet which will allow them to travel around the virtual world without sacrificing hand space which will be used for performing tasks, unlike other virtual reality games which use handheld controllers. The sounds will be recorded from the same workplaces as the virtual world to again give an immersive feel. With the machinery that may be used in the workplace, 
								replicas of the cabs will be made with working controls that are the same as real life. The software used, as said previously will be Unreal engine and various Autodesk applications, and the hardware that will be used will include an oculus rift, which is the virtual reality headset, motion capture gloves which can be source from multiple companies such as CyberGlove systems, custom made replica tools and machinery to replicate real 
								ones with motion capture sensors, a powerful computer able to run vr at moderate graphics and a motion capture studio. The skills required to successfully achieve my project are heavily reliant on programming which is done in all aspects of the software used. Experience in the hardware used must be evident as much of it is very complex, especially the motion capture technology. The hardware may be difficult to source because it is extremely expensive to fund as well as the creation 
								of custom pieces, which follows onto the question of the possibility of executing this project. I do not believe I will be able to achieve because of cost and accessibility, as well as the realism of this project however I do find this very interesting and hope it does become possible. However an alternative way to achieve this project with less cost and effort would be to use vr controllers instead of motion tracking. This will be a far more feasible option as it is easier to access and program. 
								If this project is successful it can be used to train labour intensive employees as well as test their skills in the workplace without risking serious injury. This project could save lives if it is successful and 
								furthermore can also branch off to create almost fully immersive games.</p>
