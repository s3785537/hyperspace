									<h2>Personal Information</h2>
									<p>Student number: s3785537<p>
									<p>Email address: s3785537@student.rmit.edu.au<p>
									<p> <p>
									<p>My name is Amante Docherty and i am a first year student at RMIT University studying Information Technology. I was born in Melbourne Australia and am currently living in Werribee with my Mum, Dad and my two younger sisters. My mum is from the Philippines and moved to Australia, and my dad was born in Australia after his family moved to Australia after Scotland. Some of my hobbies include gaming, freestyle bmx, and watching such like YouTube or Netflix. Games that I like to play are mainly motorsport games like Assetto Corsa, Forza, Gran Turismo and Need For Speed. Other genres of games I like are fps, open world games and whatever I can play for free. In my spare time when I don't feel like playing games i like to watch YouTube and Netflix. YouTube videos that I like to watch are car related videos, gaming videos, vlogs, music videos and fashion/streetwear videos. An interesting fact about me is that I have pet dog named Marvel who I've had since I was 3, but recently found out that I'm allergic to dogs.

									<h2>Interest In IT & my Ideal Job</h2>
									<p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there particular event or person that sparked your interests? Outline your IT experience (If any).<p>
									<p>- My interest in IT is how it is now associated with many aspects of our lives and society, as well as the things that we are able to create with the help of IT. Another part of IT which i have an interest in is games, as they have been part of most of  my life. A reason I have chosen IT is so that I can learn about what goes on behind the technology that people use daily. I find it fascinating that technology has created the world we are living in today and that the possibilities of it are endless. From when I was born to know technology has advanced greatly, providing new capabilities with appliances that were first created many years before. An example of this are mobile phones which are now able to take photos/videos, answer questions, give you directions, communicate with people from all around the world via text, voice or video, etc. My interest in IT is to be part of its growth and applications to make the world a better place. I do not know exactly when my interest in IT started however getting my first laptop may have been a contributor to this. In 2011 when I was in grade 5 I had got a MacBook from my schools BYOD(Bring Your Own Device) program, which I had constantly used to do school work, play games, use photoshop and video editing, until its hard drive crashed in 2015. One person who might have sparked my interest was my video editing teacher who had a background in Information Technology who then later was my computing teacher in year 11. My IT experience is very limited however i have done a small amount of java coding in year 11 computing class. Last year I had built my first computer which I was a fun and exciting experience as I learned about the parts that make up a computer.<p>

									<p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<p>
									<p>- I chose RMIT because I had been to many events held at RMIT such as open days, Atar Notes lectures and a day in the life where i was able to feel as though I was a student at RMIT. Through these events I experienced the positive culture and atmosphere the institution had to offer and made it clear that I wanted to be part of it. As well as this the SNAP program that RMIT provides helped me get into IT as I did not perform as well as I wanted in VCE. Another reason I chose RMIT is because of the location. Although it is far from my home in Werribee I am able to easily access a train station to catch a train straight to RMIT. I love the fact that RMIT is based in the city because it makes my experience studying feel more lively and there is a large variety of food and activities I can access when I am not studying.<p>

									<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<p>
									- During my studies at RMIT I expect to learn various coding languages and how to apply it to real world problems. With this i am also hoping to be able understand how games and other applications are made, and how they work. With my current interest in networking, cyber security, programming and games I want to learn the skills I need to work in company's where i can practice these skills as a job. I also want to be able to make a hobby out of these interests where I can make new relationships with people of the same interest and furthermore expand from what I have learned from my studies.
